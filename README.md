# Sumobot_example_no1
A simple demonstration code for a sumobot made with the following hardware:  - 1x Saleng Uno (or arduino) - 1x Kimat Mobot Shield - 2x Saleng Tracker - 1x ultrasonic sensor - 1x Sharp gp2y0a21yk0f aka IR distance - 4x 9V DC motors with wheels - 3x 3.7V Li Ion Battery set in series - mechnical parts  This is a demo code and should be  treated as a guide in implemneting the final code. There are several other techniques and algorithms that may be implmeneted. This in particular , is a rudimentary "rotate-and-wait" method.
